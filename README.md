[![Fire3D overview](assets/teaser_v3.png)](assets/teaser_v3.pdf)

Fire3D is a unified feed-forward framework that transforms a single RGB image
or casual RGB video into simulation-ready 3D scene assets. It predicts a
compositional scene representation with object-level 6-DoF pose, bounding box,
mesh geometry, and texture, without test-time optimization.

This release provides the inference code, model checkpoints, processed example
inputs, and frozen protocols needed to reproduce Fire3D results on iTHOR,
Imaginarium, ScanNet++, and single-image scenes.

## TODO

- [x] Inference code release
- [x] Model release
- [x] Inference data release
- [x] Training code release
- [x] Training-data source and preprocessing references

## Installation

The reference environment uses Linux, Python 3.10, CUDA 12.8, PyTorch 2.7.1,
and Blender 4.5.1 LTS. A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU is required; the release
protocols were validated on a 96 GB GPU.

Setup uses pyenv for the interpreter and a project-local virtualenv for the
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiahongchi/Fire3D.git
cd Fire3D
bash scripts/install.sh        # creates ./.venv from pyenv Python 3.10/3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/install_blender.sh
```

`scripts/install.sh` builds the CUDA extensions used by O-Voxel and CuMesh, and
installs cmake/ninja into the venv when the host has no usable copy. Install a
CUDA 12.8-compatible NVIDIA driver and a C++ compiler first: `nvcc` has to be
on `PATH` (or under `CUDA_HOME`), and the script stops early when it is not.
The interpreter pyenv already resolves -- its global, or this checkout's
`.python-version` -- is reused when it is 3.10.x or 3.11.x, and installed only
when the machine has neither; set `FIRE3D_PYTHON_VERSION` to pin an exact
build. DINOv3 is installed at its pinned source revision and remains subject to
the DINOv3 license in `licenses/DINOV3_LICENSE.md`.

CUDA source builds are parallelism-capped (`FIRE3D_BUILD_JOBS`, default 2):
unsupervised ninja builds start one `nvcc` per core at several GB each and get
the process OOM-killed (exit 137) inside a memory-limited container. flash-attn
is the step that hits this, so the installer first tries the project's prebuilt
wheel -- note that upstream's published wheels for the pinned release cover
torch <= 2.6, so with the pinned torch 2.7.1 it usually falls through to the
bounded source build (several GB of RAM, 1-3 hours of CPU). Pods that cannot
compile CUDA at all can install the prebuilt xformers backend instead:

```bash
FIRE3D_ATTENTION_BACKEND=xformers bash scripts/install.sh
# then export both variables in the serving environment:
export ATTN_BACKEND=xformers SPARSE_ATTN_BACKEND=xformers
```

For the Gradio web interface, build the environment with its extras:

```bash
FIRE3D_WITH_WEBUI=1 bash scripts/install.sh
# or, into an environment that already exists:
python -m pip install -e ".[webui]"
```

## Download

Download the model once and select the dataset examples you want to run:

```bash
fire3d download --models
fire3d download --data --dataset ithor --scene-id iTHOR_FloorPlan312_physics
fire3d download --data --dataset imaginarium --scene-id bedroom_01
fire3d download --data --dataset scannetpp --scene-id 09bced689e
fire3d download --data --dataset single_image --scene-id 003025
fire3d download --evaluation shaper
```

Omit `--scene-id` to download every whitelisted scene in a selected dataset.
Running `fire3d download` without selectors downloads the model and all four
whitelisted processed data subsets. Archives are verified and extracted into:

```text
checkpoints/Fire3D/   # hongchi/Fire3D
data/                 # datasets/hongchi/Fire3D
```

## Inference

Each command below runs perception, object reconstruction, scene composition,
camera sampling, and rendering with a frozen release protocol:

```bash
bash scripts/run_ithor_example.sh
bash scripts/run_imaginarium_example.sh
bash scripts/run_scannetpp_example.sh
bash scripts/run_single_image_example.sh
```

The equivalent unified command accepts another scene from the same downloaded
dataset:

```bash
fire3d infer \
  --dataset ithor \
  --scene-id iTHOR_FloorPlan312_physics \
  --gpu 0
```

Use `--skip-render` when only perception and textured scene meshes are needed.
Outputs are written under `results/<dataset>/<scene-id>/` by default. Every run
records its resolved protocol and exact subprocess commands.

| Dataset | Release example | Input adapter | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| iTHOR | `iTHOR_FloorPlan312_physics` | posed RGB-D video | `fire3d_video_v1` |
| Imaginarium | `bedroom_01` | posed RGB-D video | `fire3d_video_v1` |
| ScanNet++ | `09bced689e` | Pi3 RGB-D sequence with confidence filtering | `fire3d_scannetpp_v1` |
| Single image | `003025` | aligned RGB and point cloud | `fire3d_single_image_v1` |

The iTHOR, Imaginarium, and ScanNet++ protocols enable the background room-box
fit and use its isotropic enclosing transform before background reconstruction.
Single-image inference preserves its separate input-aligned background policy.

The ScanNet++ and single-image protocols use the same batched execution path as
the video protocol: SS/shape/PBR flow batches of 16, VAE decode chunks of 16,
CuMesh batches of 8, parallel UV unwrapping, and power-of-two sparse material
queries. Their dataset-specific sampling and remeshing settings remain frozen.

## Web UI

The release ships a Gradio server that turns **one uploaded RGB photo** into a
textured, interactive 3D scene, so no video, pose, or depth input is needed:

```bash
fire3d serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --auth user:secret
```

Start-up fetches the model bundle, the pinned DINOv3 source tree, and a
monocular depth checkpoint automatically (sentinel-based, so restarts are
cheap), then serves a page you can open from a laptop on the same network. The
frozen `fire3d_single_image_v1` protocol still does the reconstruction: the
upload is turned into a `single_image` scene directory (`rgb.jpeg`,
`aligned_pcd.ply`, `camera.json`) under `data/webui/single_image`, and the
WebUI then runs `fire3d infer` unchanged. Outputs land in
`outputs/webui/<scene_id>/`, with the scene at
`reconstruction/<scene_id>/appearance/predicted_textured_world_scene.glb`.

Because the protocol conditions on an organized point cloud rather than on the
RGB image alone, the WebUI estimates metric depth (Depth Anything V2
Metric-Indoor) and back-projects it into the gravity-aligned, metre-scaled world
frame the released single-image scenes use. See [docs/webui.md](docs/webui.md)
for the deployment guide, environment variables, and troubleshooting.

## Method

[![Fire3D method](assets/method_overview.png)](assets/method_overview.pdf)

Fire3D lifts image features into a shared 3D point cloud, predicts scene
instances and oriented boxes, and reconstructs each object through cascaded
sparse-structure, shape, and PBR flow-matching models. Sparse VAE decoders and
the O-Voxel/CuMesh postprocessor produce individually transformable textured
meshes and a composed scene GLB.

### Hierarchical Compression VAE

[![Fire3D HC-VAE](assets/hcvae.png)](assets/hcvae.pdf)

Figure 3 shows the Hierarchical Compression VAE (HC-VAE), the compact object
representation that makes scene-level generation practical. TRELLIS.2's
Sparse Compression VAE (SC-VAE) first maps an O-Voxel into sparse shape and
material fields at resolution `32^3` with 32 channels. Fire3D's HC-VAE then
compresses each field into an `8^3` representation with 64 channels, reducing
the latent volume by 32x while preserving the geometry and appearance decoded
by the frozen SC-VAE. The compact shape and PBR latents let Fire3D batch flow
sampling and VAE decoding across many scene instances.

### Sparse-Structure VAE

The sparse-structure VAE jointly learns an encoder and decoder for binary
object support on an `8^3` grid. Its encoder maps occupancy to an
`8 x 2 x 2 x 2` latent, and its decoder reconstructs occupancy logits used by
the first stage of the reconstruction cascade. Both sides are released under
stable aliases. The normal joint-training recipe, dataset contract, and
one-GPU launch command are documented in
[training/README.md](training/README.md#sparse-structure-vae).

### Released Models

`fire3d download --models` installs the following stable model aliases. Public

## Training And Evaluation

The release includes the full model-side training paths for scene perception,
the sparse-structure/shape/PBR flow cascade, the jointly trained
sparse-structure VAE, and the shape/PBR HC-VAEs. Public configs retain the
architectures, objectives, augmentations, and latent contracts used for the
released models while replacing cluster paths with explicit environment
roots. See [training/README.md](training/README.md). The released VAE recipes
use one process on one GPU; each configured per-GPU batch size is therefore
the effective global batch size.

Perception evaluation and the iTHOR/Imaginarium reconstruction benchmarks are
under `eval/perception/` and `benchmarks/scene_reconstruction/`. A compact,
pickle-free ShapeR GT bundle can be installed with
`fire3d download --evaluation shaper`.

The dataset-processing reference covers SAGE-10K, InternScenes, MansionWorld,
iTHOR, ProcTHOR, SceneSmith, Imaginarium, 3D-FUTURE, ABO, HSSD, and the GitHub
and Sketchfab subsets of Objaverse. It includes scene rendering, transform
export, O-Voxel generation, and sparse latent encoding. Upstream source data is
not redistributed. All training sources are publicly available and retain
their original licenses and access terms. For object training data, use
[TRELLIS-500K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS-500K),
which provides the metadata and preparation tools for the ObjaverseXL, ABO,
3D-FUTURE, and HSSD sources used by the object pipeline. Official scene-data
links are collected in
[data_processing/README.md](data_processing/README.md#source-downloads).

Baseline adapters for EFM3D, Boxer, SceneScript, ShapeR, SAM3D Objects,
TRELLIS.2, SimRecon, HoloScene, and LiteReality use pinned upstream revisions;
their repositories and checkpoints remain separate. See
[baselines/README.md](baselines/README.md).
